# Features

## Backend Development: 
Built a scalable backend for a ride-booking app with core features like user authentication, ride 
management, payment processing, and driver allocation. 

## Authentication & Security: 
Secured user sessions with JWT-based authentication using Spring Security. 

## Modular Architecture: 
Designed a services-like structure with modular entities (User, Ride, Payment, Wallet, Rating) for 
efficient data management.

Integrated OSRM API for route optimization and used the Strategy Design Pattern to support surge pricing and fare strategies. 
Used Postgre SQL and PostGIS as the database.

## Additional Functionalities:
Implemented OTP and email notifications, wallet management, and a rating system; documented 
APIs with Swagger and thoroughly tested services.
